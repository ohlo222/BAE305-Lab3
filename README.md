# BAE305-Lab3

# Summary
The first part of this lab is how Circuit simulation is formed online. This is a helpful tool for when there is trouble measuring accurate values, or before you build the physical circuit you can have an estimation of what values your circuit should be reading. Computer software circuit simulators can also calculate ideal theoretical behavior from Kirchhoff’s Laws and allows you to try out many variations of the designed circuit. So, in this lab we will be using using the simulation software provided to verify Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), and to apply Thevenin’s and superposition theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits.

Our Overall Tasks are
- To verify the validity of KVL and KCL laws.
- To apply the superposition and Thevenin’s theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits.
- To confirm the validity of Thevenin’s and superposition theorems.

# Test Procedures
Part 1. Series Circuit
-	Using voltage probes, measure the voltage drop across each resistor in the above circuit (both simulation and on the breadboard).
- Using the current probe measure the current in the circuit (simulation only – We have lost too many multimeter fuses!).
- Record the results in a table.

Part 2. Parallel Circuit
- Measure and record the branch currents I1, I2, I4, I5, I6, I7. (Branch numbers refer to resistors.) Please make sure to take the direction of the current flows into account.
- Verify that the current leaving a node is equal to the current entering the node. Q1: In your lab report show currents entering and leaving a node using equations. (Ex: I5 = I6 + I7). 

Part 2.2 KVL
- Using voltage probes measure and record the voltage drop across all resistors. R1-R8.

Part 3. Potentiometer
- Given a sensor that ranges from 0-19.650K Ohms and a 14.1V input voltage, determine the correct resistance (R?) to place in series with the sensor to yield a voltage output between 0-5V across the sensor.
