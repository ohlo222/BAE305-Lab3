# BAE305-Lab3
# By: Spencer Givan, Chrissy Witt, Olivia Lohre
# Summary
The first part of this lab is how Circuit simulation is formed online. This is a helpful tool for when there is trouble measuring accurate values, or before you build the physical circuit you can have an estimation of what values your circuit should be reading. Computer software circuit simulators can also calculate ideal theoretical behavior from Kirchhoff’s Laws and allows you to try out many variations of the designed circuit. So, in this lab we will be using using the simulation software provided to verify Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), and to apply Thevenin’s and superposition theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits.

Our Overall Tasks are
- To verify the validity of KVL and KCL laws.
- To apply the superposition and Thevenin’s theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits.
- To confirm the validity of Thevenin’s and superposition theorems.
